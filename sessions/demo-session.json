    "content": " Formula One (F1) and Formula Two (F2) are both open-wheel racing series, but they have several key differences:\n\n1. Classification: Formula One is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), while Formula Two is a lower category below Formula One.\n\n2. Cars: In Formula One, cars are more technologically advanced and complex with sophisticated aerodynamics, turbocharged engines, and advanced electronic systems. Formula Two cars are less advanced, using naturally-aspirated engines and simpler electronics.\n\n3. Race Duration: A Formula One Grand Prix race typically consists of 57-68 laps over a distance of approximately 305 km (190 mi), while a Formula Two race is usually shorter, consisting of 24-30 laps covering around 150 km (93 mi).\n\n4. Points System: The points system in Formula One rewards the top ten finishers with points, while in Formula Two only the top eight finishers receive points.\n\n5. Teams and Drivers: The teams and drivers participating in Formula One are typically more established and well-funded compared to those in Formula Two. This makes it more difficult for new teams or drivers to break into Formula One, as they often need significant financial backing.",
